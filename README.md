# FindMyFlatMate
This is a website that allows students to advertise spaces in their student accomadation on a map, along with contact detials, allowing students looking for a room for the next academic year can easily find one in the location they prefer. This was inspired by my own experiences at Univeristy where there was a Facebook Group with thousands of people posting empty rooms as well as many other miscellaneous posts, making it very hard to find an appropriate room.

# Technologies
This website uses HTML, CSS, javascript, PHP and the GoogleMapsAPI along with an AWS database to provide the users with the service.

# What I learned
During this project, that was made for a hackathon (GreatUniHack 2018), I learnt how to integrate external API's into websites using javascript as well as connecting a PHP backend to AWS databases. In addition I learnt the basics of constructing XML files from database calls using javascript. 

# How to run this
Unfortunately since this was made at a Hackathon, we used a throwaway account for GoogleMapsAPI as well as AWS and so these will no longer function if you copy the code from this repository. However if you changed the keys for your own, and provided a database with the appropriate format (sorry I can't remember what that was!) then it should function.
